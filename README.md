## Bolus Buddy

A simple app that enables diabetics to easily calculate the amount of insulin they need based on the amound of carbs they have recently eaten and their food to insulin bolus ratio. 

### Goals of this app.

I wanted to create an app to help people, like myself, with Type-1 Diabetes. This was my first independent endeavor into Android Development, after spending several months toying and playing with it.I plan to continue working with Android, Java, and Kotlin in the future.

### Design

I prefer a minimal design with few colors and subtlety in the app. I try to follow the Material Guidelines that Google provides to a certain extent, but feel that showing my own flair for design is a more important thing than almost anything else.
